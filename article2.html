          The DHL Fastest Lap Award is given annually by the courier, Formula
          One global partner and logistics provider DHL “to recognise the driver
          who most consistently demonstrates pure speed, with the fastest lap at
          the highest number of races each season”, and to reward the winning
          driver for “characteristics such as excellent performance, passion,
          can-do attitude, reliability and precision”. First awarded in 2007 by
          DHL, the trophy's official naming patron, it is presented to the
          driver with the highest number of fastest laps over the course of the
          season, with one point awarded to the fastest lap holder of a Grand
          Prix. In the event of a tie, there is a countback and the driver with
          the highest number of second-fastest laps earns the award. If this is
          also tied, third-fastest laps are considered, and so on, until a
          winner is found. The trophy is presented to the winning driver at the
          final round of the season.
        </p>

          The inaugural winner was the Ferrari driver Kimi Räikkönen with six
          fastest laps in 2007. The award has been decided on a tiebreaker on
          four occasions. Räikkönen and his teammate Felipe Massa tied with six
          fastest laps and two-second-quickest laps in 2007 with the former
          winning by having more third-fastest laps than the latter. In 2009,
          Red Bull Racing's Sebastian Vettel and his teammate Mark Webber had
          three fastest laps at the end of the season but Vettel won with two
          more second-fastest laps than the latter. Ferrari driver Fernando
          Alonso and McLaren's Lewis Hamilton each had five fastest laps in 2010
          with Alonso finishing ahead with a higher number of second-best laps.
          In 2021, both Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen set six fastest
          laps with Hamilton declared the winner for recording more
          second-fastest laps than Verstappen.

          British drivers have won the award seven times, German drivers four
          times, and Finnish racers three times. Mercedes have won on seven
          occasions to Red Bull Racing's six and Ferrari's three. The 2024
          recipient was Lando Norris of the McLaren team with six fastest laps,
          the first time he and his team won the award.
